<h4>What gear should I bring and what do you provide?</h4>
<p>
When you book onto one of our trips, we will send you a full pre-trip package. Included in that will be a gear and clothing list specific to your trip, with example suggestions. If you own your own backpack, tent, sleeping bag and pad, we encouraged you to bring it for fit and familiarity. However, SYMG can also provide state of the art gear free of charge at your request. We also provide all stoves, cooking and eating-ware, water filters, etc.
</p>
<h4>What's a typical day like on a backcountry trip?</h4>

<p>
Typically, the guides get up and get hot water going for strong coffee and morning drinks around 6:30. You can begin packing your personal clothing and gear. we will have breakfast, finish up camp breakdown and hit the trail around 8-9am depending on the days mileage. We stop as a group for snack and lunch breaks. We hit camp in the later afternoon (again, dependent on mileage). After setting up camp, youâ€™ll have time to relax, swim, fish or wash clothes before dinner, prepared by the guides. Each trip is different and some have more "down time" than others.
</p>
<h4>What are my duties while on a backcountry trip?</h4>
<p>
We take pride in our efforts as a full service outfitter. As our guest, you are only responsible for setting up and taking down your own tent, packing your personal gear, and filtering your own water. Of course, our guides are always available to assist. Other camp chores such as cooking, cleaning, hauling water, packing up/down of camp, etc are left to the guides, leaving you to relax and enjoy the backcountry.
</p>

<h4>How fit and/or experienced do I need to be?</h4>
<p>
We offer a variety of trips and can suit the needs of any ability level. During the booking process, it is common to have a conversation with our office staff to make sure that you are joining the trip that is best for you. Our office staff are all current and former guides and have lead all the trips in our catalog.
